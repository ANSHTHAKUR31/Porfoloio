<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there, I'm Ansh Thakur – a relentless seeker of knowledge and a technology enthusiast with a knack for problem-solving. My educational journey kicked off at Cosmos Public School, where I laid the foundation for my academic pursuits. Fuelled by a passion for understanding how things work, I ventured into the world of mechanical engineering at the Delhi Institute of Tool Engineering, earning myself a diploma along the way.</p>


<p> Driven by a desire to explore the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I transitioned into the Information Technology program at BPIT College, affiliated with Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University. It was here that I delved into the world of programming, mastering languages like C and Java, while also completing the GDSC course to further broaden my skill set.</p>
  
<p>Currently, I'm deeply engrossed in sharpening my skills in web development and diving into the complexities of Data Structures and Algorithms, all in the versatile realm of Java. Beyond academics, I find solace and joy in the spirited games of badminton and cricket – a testament to my love for sports and staying active.</p>
  
<p> While my roots trace back to Bihar, I've come to call Faridabad my home, where I continue to chase my dreams and aspirations. Although my initial ambition was to serve in the Indian Army, life had other plans, nudging me towards the boundless possibilities of the tech world. Despite the challenges along the way, I remain steadfast in my pursuit of growth, embracing each hurdle as an opportunity to learn and evolve.</p>
